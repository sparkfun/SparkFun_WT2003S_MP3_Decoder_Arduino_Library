# description
The WT2003S is an all-in-one SD card based MP3 player. It combines the steps of obtaining a bitstream that represents audio and decoding that bitstream into a stereo audio output. A microSD card is used to store MP3 files to be played later. On the WT2003S MP3 Decoder Breakout there is also a built in audio amplifier, 3.5mm stereo headphone jack, and mono speaker output that uses a poke-home connector to make rapid prototyping a cinch. To get going just insert a microSD card with your desired files, connect the breakout to a serial port, and use the provided Arduino library for full-featured control. 

Here's what sets the WT2003S breakout board apart from other products:
- Provides direct access to the WT2003S serial interface, as opposed to the [*Qwiic MP3 Trigger*](link).
- Small form factor and single-sided PCB simplifies mounting for a project.
- Built-in amplifier allows direct connection of a speaker up to 1.4W. 

- There are no *trigger* pins that can directly play an MP3 when a certain event happens, but you can make that happen in your project with a microcontroller.
- The WT2003S only supports MP3 and WAV files, and cannot *encode* audio like the [MP3 Decoder Shield]().

You may prefer to use this product instead of the [Qwiic version](link) if you don't already use I2C in a project, have an extra serial port, or want to control the WT2003S from a computer using a common USB to serial converter. 

It's always nice to have a dedicated microSD card for a given project so consider purchasing a spare [small-capacity microSD card](link) in case you don't have one already.
